Write a brief paragraph explaining “asynchronous mechanism” following these steps:

1. Term: Clearify state the term

   A way to organize tasks which allows them to execute independently of the main execution flow

2. Class: Identify the general category it belongs to

   Computing process

3. Differentiation: Describe what makes it unique within that category

   Unlike synchronous operations, which execute tasks one by one and block further execution until completion, asynchronous mechanisms enable non-blocking execution, improving efficiency and responsiveness.

4. Context/Examples: Provide context or examples to further clarify the term

   This approach is widely used in **event-driven programming** and **network requests**. For example, in JavaScript, the `async/await` syntax and Promises allow non-blocking operations like fetching data from an API without freezing the user interface, and response to user actions with instant feedbacks.
