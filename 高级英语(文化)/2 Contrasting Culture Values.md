Chapter 2: Contrasting Cultural Values

*To be successful in international business and to be good citizens of the international community, we should learn to honor and respect our own cultures and also to develop an appreciation, tolerance, and respect for other cultures.*



# 1 Cultrual Values

Values fundamentally influence our behaviors in society. They do not describe how we act in a culture but dictate what we ought or ought not to do. Values tend to be the basis of all the decisions we make and provide standards for us to evaluate our own and other's actions. Thus a value can be defined as a conception, explicit or implicit, distinctive of an individual or characteristic of a group, of the desirable which influences the selection from available modes, means, and ends of action.

Values are a learned organization of rules for making choices and for resolving conflicts. These rules and guideposts are normative and teach us what is useful, good, right, wrong, what to strive for, how to live our life, and even what to die for. A value system represents what is expected or hoped for, required or forbidden. It is not a report of actual conduct but is the system of criteria by which conduct is judged and sanctions applied.

Values are useful in explaining and understanding cultural similarities and differences in behaviors; thus, understanding values and their cultural basis is helpful for managers in international business. If they understand how values vary from culture to culture, they are more likely to accept and interpret correctly behavioral differences. This acceptance and correct interpretation, in turn, enables managers to interact effectively with others whose values and behaviors are different.

Every culture has its ways of doing things in daily life, such as ways of eating, drinking, dressing, finding shelters, making friends, marrying, and dealing with death. People have to learn the cultural ways of their community to satisfy their basic human needs. These ways are not something that the people in the group are born with. Instinctive behavior, on the other hand, is a pattern of behavior that an animal is born with. Spiders spinning their webs is an example. The mother spider does not teach her babies how to spin webs. In fact, she is not even there when they are born. Young spiders know how to do it when they are born.

We have to remember that, most of the time, the different customs of different cultures are neither right nor wrong. It is simply that different people do things in different manners.

Although each of us has a unique set of values, there are also values that tend to permeate a culture. These are called cultural values.

## 1.1 Comparison Between Chinese Values and Western Values
Many scholars have written about cultural differences between the West and the East. A.lllong these differences, three are highlighted here: cognition, relationship with nature, and the concept of truth. Western people are said to incline to think in a linear fashion. A cause leads to an effect. In Eastern culture, a cause can lead to an effect and it can be an effect as well. Past, present and future are interconnected and affect one another. Western culture tends to be oriented toward mastery over nature while Eastern culture seeks harmony with nature. Regarding the concept of truth, the view of Western culture on ultimate truth or reality is based more on scientific and empirical explanation while that of Eastern culture is based more on existing truth. Cultural differences between the East and the West have a significant impact on the communication behavior and pattern. As a result of the differences in cognition, relationship with nature and the concept of truth, people from the West and the East are further different in the following aspects.

**Differences in expressing gratitude.** The Chinese and Westerners are different in expressing their gratitude. The Chinese who are close to each other seldom express their gratitude in public or in words. Look at the following situation. A mother is busy in the kitchen. She suddenly asks her son to fetch a bowl for her. Then the son does so. The mother just continues cooking without any word of gratitude. Later at table, the mother hands her son a bowl of rice. The son just takes it and begins eating without any word of gratitude either. If such a situation happens in the United States, both the mother and her son will say "thanks" or "thank you" for fetching the bowl and serving the rice.

Differences in symbolization. Symbolization is how people imagine or regard something. It actually reflects the way people think. The Chinese and Westerners are different in symbolizing. In the APEC summit held in Shanghai in 2001, with the closing day coming, Presidents from all over the world were invited to wea the traditional Chinese Tang suits for a photo together. The Tang suits were ready, and then the Presidents were asked to choose the colors of the suits by themselves. However, it was quite interesting to find that most of the Easterners chose red while most of the Westerners preferred blue. Red means luck and fortune in most Eastern cultures but stands for blood, revolution in the West. Blue means something noble or significant in the Western culture.

Differences in attitudes toward women. The Chinese and Westerners are different in attitudes toward women. "Ladies First" has a long history in the West. But in China there is no such a tradition. For example, a respectable elderly gentleman is having dinner with a young lady in a restaurant. In China, it is normally the elderly man who gets the service first, because hierarchy is prevalent in China and it is the elderly or the superior who is supposed to get special respect. But in the West, it is likely the young lady who is first served because of their "Ladies First" tradition.

> With changes in women's roles, there have been changes in customs. Women used to expect that men would open doors for them, but now they open their own. When a man invited a woman out for dinner in the past, he was expected to pay for everything. Today, a woman might share the bill when she goes out with a man. She can be the one who calls a man up and asks him out. She may even pay for the entire date.

## 1.2 Comparison Between Chinese Values and American Values
It is true that Chinese people and American people enjoy different cultures, which influence their life, customs and behaviors, beliefs and values, aesthetic and interest. The following is going to provide us with a better understanding of the differences between Chinese and American cultures.

**Differences in friendship.** Friendship means a lot to the Chinese. There is a Chinese saying: "One more friend, one more road." Whenever they have made friends with someone, they will try all their efforts to make the friendship as close as possible, and keep him as a lifelong friend. Lifelong friends feel deeply obligated to give each other whatever help might be required. Americans, however, change their friends and acquaintances over time and have limited mutual obligation. They will try to help their friends in difficulty with some advice but avoid making a decision for them.

**Differences in time consciousness.** The Chinese relatively pay more attention to the past. They cherish old classmates and friends. If they happen to visit a city, they will squeeze their time to have a get-together with friends there. Americans usually are less interested in the past. Instead, they focus on what is going on for the time being. They believe that life is like a fast moving train. If you miss it, you are out of date.

> In 2001, I attended a TESOL conference in St. Louis. I planned to stay in the States for a few more days after the seven-day conference. Before I started my traveling, I called or e-mailed some of my old friends in the cities I had planned to visit. To my great delight, they all agreed to take me anytime I arrived. I spent one day in Chicago, three days in Los Angeles, and five days in Seattle. All of the old friends went to the airports to meet me in their cars and showed me around the cities during my stay. My traveling, my food and my overnight accommodations were all free.

**Differences in conception of the self.** The Chinese are collectivist, placing high value on group cooperation and individual modesty. So many Chinese are used to beginning their English conversation with "My English is poor." Americans are individualist, placing high value on self-reliance and freedom from externally imposed constraints. At the beginning of a presentation, the American will say: "I believe that my presentation will be of great value to anybody present."

> A Chinese visited an American friend in the United States. It was 11:00 p.m. He thought it was time for him to leave. Then he said, "Mr. Steve, it is too late, you should have a rest. I bother you so much; I am sorry for that." The American friend angrily answered, "No, come on. I don't think you are bothering me. We had a good talk. Listen, if you want to go, it is because you want to go, not because of me."

**Differences in approaches to tasks.** The Chinese are relationship-oriented. They often maintain a harmonious relationship with some people, which has priority over accomplishing tasks. They don't care as much about schedules or timelines. Meetings may run long. Americans are task-oriented. They focus on a scheduled timeline and would like to do one thing at a time. In their opinion, relationships are less important than getting the work done.

**Differences in social relationships.** The Chinese have formal and hierarchical social relationships. They feel uncomfortable while they are chatting with someone who holds a higher position. Americans have informal and egalitarian social relationships. People tend to minimize the importance of social rankings.

# 2 Cultural Dimensions

For those who work in international business, it is sometimes amazing how different people in other cultures behave. We tend to have a human instinct that all people are the same-but they are not. Therefore, if we go to another country and make decisions based on how we operate in our own country, the chances are we will make some poor decisions. Geert Hofstede's research gives us insights into other cultures so that we can be more effective when interacting with people in other countries.

Geert Hofstede is an international authority on intercultural social psychology. He analyzed a large database of employee values scores collected by IBM between 1967 and 1973 covering more than 70 countries, from which he first used the 40 largest only, and afterward extended the analysis to 50 countries and 3 regions. In the editions of his work since 2001, scores are listed for 74 countries and regions, partly based on replications and extensions of the IBM study on different international populations. Subsequent studies validating the earlier results have included commercial airline pilots and students in 23 countries, civil service managers in 14 counties, "up-market" consumers in 15 countries and "elites" in 19 countries. From the initial results, and later additions, Hofstede developed a model that identifies four primary dimensions for differentiating cultures: power distance, individualism/collectivism, masculinity/femininity and uncertainty avoidance. The value survey model has been widely discussed in international management literature and it appears to provide information of relevance from a managerial point of view.

## 2.1 Power Distance

Power distance means the extent to which the less powerful members of institutions and organizations within a country, expect and accept that power is distributed unequally. It just shows how much subordinates can consent or dissent with their superiors. It is the distance between the superior and the subordinate. Among most oriental corporate cultures, there is hierarchism, greater centralization, sometimes called "poser-oriented culture," due to historical reasons. The superiors make the decision and are entitled more privileges. Their decisions and supervision are always positively evaluated by subordinates. In this situation, it does not matter if subordinates have a disagreement with their managers, especially in China, Japan and India.

In China and some other Asian countries, power distance is also associated with "the family culture" (Trompenaars, 1993). "Family culture at their least effective drains the energies and loyalties of subordinates to buoy up the leader." (Trompenaars, 1993) In this kind of corporate culture the manager is like the "caring father" who knows better than his subordinates what should be done and what is suitable for them. The subordinates always esteem the managers because of their position and experience. There are both positive and negative aspects in the family cultures. It is just an easy managing system. But sometimes it is hard to get young creative employees work well because of the hierarchy.

### 2.1.1 Small Power Distance Cultrue

Small power distance culture values horizontal relationships where everyone is on a level playing field. Status symbols and privilege invite ridicule, and those who would set themselves above others are cut down to size. While a boss has power and authority, he must be careful to respect workers and share the benefits of that power whenever possible. Everyone is expected to have a voice in decision-making and each person or group has rights and feels free to complain when those rights are violated. There is a strong sense of what is fair, and when workers sense they are being treated unfairly, they feel free to complain and negotiate to improve their situation.

Hofstede found countries, like Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Denmark, and Finland enjoy small power distance culture. In these cultures, superiors and subordinates feel relatively comfortable with shared decision-making and decentralization. Employees are not expected to rigidly conform to authority, and people have a certain latitude for disagreement.

Small power distance countries hold that inequality in society should be minimized. People in these cultures believe that they should have access to power. To them, a hierarchy is an inequality of roles established for convenience. Subordinates consider superiors to be the same kind of people as they are, and superiors perceive their subordinates the same way. People in power, such as supervisors or government officials, often interact with their constituents and try to look less powerful than they really are. In small power distance societies the emphasis is on impersonal "truth" that can be obtained by any competent person. Small power distance culture is characterized by the following:

- Americans assume that informality is a prerequisite for sincerity. They become uncomfortable when faced with the type of ceremony, tradition, and formalized social rules found more widely throughout Europe. Moreover, they are likely to feel uneasy when others treat them with too much deference.
- Delighted with informal behavior. Americans generally take considerable delight when those in particularly high or powerful positions behave just like the everyday person on the street.
- Authority figures, such as priests, professors, and supervisors, are often called by their first name rather than their official title and last name.
- In many egalitarian societies, informality (for example, deemphasizing status differences) is reflected in the structure of everyday language. The distinction between the formal and informal you, found in such languages as German and French, requires speakers to make linguistic choices that reflect the social status of the people being addressed. In contrast, English language makes no such distinctions.
- Authority figures, such as supervisors or college professors, are allowed to admit that they don't have all the answers. Also, they will not lose respect because of mistakes.

### 2.1.2 Large Power Distance Culture

Large power distance culture emphasizes the unequal distribution of power in institutions and organizations in a hierarchy of privilege. A few people have a lot of power; the vast majority has little. Power is experienced as a personal attribute, something to be felt rather than enforced. Members of large power distance culture will usually be quiet, soft-spoken, and polite, whether they are powerful individuals or not. And ·if they feel that you are being unfriendly or uncaring, they will be silent. People of large power distance culture will show their trust in you by asking for help and direction and will show their respect by remaining formal and lowering their eyes.

Hofstede found that countries, such as China, Malaysia, South Korea, Mexico, Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Japan, enjoy large power distance culture. In these societies, people respect formal hierarchical authority, and employees seldom violate chains of command or openly question decisions by their superiors.

In large power distance societies, communication is traditionally superiorcentered. The superiors initiate all communication, outline the path of progress, and the subordinates should follow. The superiors are never publicly criticized or contradicted. The emphasis is on the personal "wisdom." Large power distance culture is characterized by the following:

- High-status people are expected to maintain their high-status and prestige at all costs. Don't expect to see Queen Elizabeth wearing Levi's in public.
- Languages are structured in such a way as to ensure that one's relative status is reflected in the very construction of a sentence.
- High-status people are expected to be addressed by their formal title followed by the last name ("Dr. Wang") rather than the first name ("Jianguo").
- Children defer to their parents, the younger defer to the older, women defer to men, employees defer to employers, students defer to teachers, sellers defer to buyers, and everyone defers to the head of state.
- Highly respected authorities are reluctant to admit they don't know certain things or they've made a mistake.
